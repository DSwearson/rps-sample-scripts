rps-sample-scripts
==================

A collection of sample scripts for the RevitPythonShell (https://code.google.com/p/revitpythonshell)

This is a repository for short RPS scripts that have no other place to stay.

  * exportImage.py - export the currently visible view as a PNG image
  * revitsnoop.py - interface to the RevitLookup tool by Jeremy Tammik

Dwane Stairmand posted some scripts to the RevitPythonShell user group (http://groups.google.com/group/RevitPythonShell)

  * RoomNameLower.py - room names to lower-case (selected)
  * RoomNameLowerAll.py - room names to lower-case (all)
  * RoomNameUpper.py - room names to upper-case (selected)
  * RoomNameUpperAll.py - room names to uper-case (all>)
  * SelectAllText.py - select all the text within a project (ready for the spell check)
  * SheetNameLowerAll.py - sheet name to lower-case (all)
  * SheetNameUpperAll.py - sheet name to upper-case (all)
  * TextLower.py - text to lower-case (selected)

  * TextUpper.py - text to upper-case (selected)
  * TextUpperAll.py - text to upper-case (all)

# StartupScripts

The folder `StartupScripts` contains some examples of using the startup script
functionality in RPS. The blog post [More control over the RibbonPanel in RevitPythonShell](http://darenatwork.blogspot.ch/2016/03/more-control-over-ribbonpanel-in.html)
contains a description of how these work:

  * simple_ribbon.py - create a new `RibbonPanel` programatically and add a `PushButton`
  * simple_ribbon_with_icon.py - same as above, but assign an icon to the `PushButton` 
  * new_ribbon_panel.py - an elaborate demo of messing with the `RibbonPanel`

# RpsAddIns

The folder `RpsAddIns` contains some examples of using the "Deploy RpsAddIn" functionality

  * NewRibbonPanel - wrap up the startup script example `new_ribbon_panel.py` as a plugin
